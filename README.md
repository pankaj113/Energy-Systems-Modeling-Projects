Proposal for: 
‘Review of Energy Systems Modeling Groups/Projects’

BACKGROUND
The historical developments that paralleled the electrification of Finland  is instructive and compelling to read. Worldwide electrification technology presented itself as an organic outcome of natural growth of scientific and engineering knowledge. It occurred without a larger reason or purpose driving it. Articles in Finnish newspapers then, talked and argued about how much better life is when we have an electric lamp in the home or when electricity is available for the city. Electrification added to possibilities of better life and living. Better life was a choice, not a requirement.
Present energy transition considerations invariably weigh upon the reader as he turns the pages and peeks at the different stages of scientific, market and political developments and how these forces warped their way in the ‘life of a country’ and its people.
Earlier, the context was of new ways of using the abundantly available resources. In stark contrast, we now operate in a depleting resource environment where we are required to optimise our ‘systems of resource use’. 
‘Energy Systems Modeling’ is a concept with the promise to evolve relevant systems that meaningfully align with the ‘larger purpose’. 

PROPOSAL
The possibilities in the concept ‘Energy Systems Modeling’ is unpacked in myriad ways by different organisations and research groups. The proposal is to review the ongoing projects, which build upon different perspectives and aspects of ‘Energy Systems’.
Following are some example projects that could be covered:
1.	http://www.energyplan.eu/
2.	https://crei.skoltech.ru/energysystems/research/research-projects/
3.	https://ensystra.eu/
4.	http://fractal-grid.eu/
5.	https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=slick-sheet-project/packetized-energy-management
6.	http://www.uvm.edu/~phines/projects/
